   :description lang=en: Introduction to Swerve Drives and how they work


Swerve Drives (hopefully) move on a 2D plane, which means we can apply kinematics to the drive (you learn kinematics in Physics 1)

There are two main forces are play with a Swerve Drive:

* Linear force, which you can think as a force moving it in a straight line
* Rotational force, which you can think as a force that rotates an object

We can combine these two forces using kinematics in order to move in any direction and rotation at the same time!

Kinematics
----------

Kinematics is a field of physics used to describe motion of points and objects, it is sometimes also known as the geometry of motion. Kinematics deals with how an object moves without looking at the cause

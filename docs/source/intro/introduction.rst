   :description lang=en: Introduction to Swerve Drives and how they work


Swerve Drives are considered to be the most versatile drive in FRC, with the ability too:

* Move with the agility of a holonomic drive
* Have the force of a tank drive
* Gives ability to move and turn at the same time

Despite these abilities Swerve also lacks in some departments:

* Requires 8 motors, much greater than other drives which can be run with only 4 or 6
* Heavier than other drives
* Incredibly expensive to produce in comparison to other drives
* Much more complicated to program, to the point that this documentation is almost necessary
* Break easily in comparison to other drives

So What is a Swerve Drive?

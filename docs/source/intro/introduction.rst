   :description lang=en: Introduction to Swerve Drives and how they work


Swerve Drives are considered to be the most versatile drive in FRC, with the ability too:

* Move with the agility of a holonomic drive
* Have the force of a tank drive
* Gives ability to move and turn at the same time

Despite these abilities Swerve also lacks in some departments:

* Requires 8 motors, much greater than other drives which can be run with only 4 or 6
* Heavier than other drives
* Incredibly expensive to produce in comparison to other drives
* Much more complicated to program, to the point that this documentation is almost necessary
* Break easily in comparison to other drives

What is a Swerve Drive?
--------------------------

.. seealso:: A standard drive has a left and right set of wheels and cannot turn the wheels at all. They are essentially stuck only moving in a pitch.

Swerve Drives control both the pitch and the yaw of the wheel. In order to control both the wheel and the direction it is headed 

The usual example for this is a shopping cart, if you've been to places like Walmart look at the front wheels of a shopping cart, the wheels are able to rotate on the same plane as the floor, letting it turn easier.

How good is swerve drive?
   Swerve is largely considered to be the best drive in FRC with some of the top teams (148, 254) switching to swerve, and perennial swerves (1323, 2910, 2767) consistently performing well. In fact, 2017 - 2019 all had alliance leaders that used swerve.

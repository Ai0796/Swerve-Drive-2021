   :description lang=en: Introduction to Swerve Drives and how they work


Swerve Drives (hopefully) move on a 2D plane, which means we can apply kinematics to the drive (you learn kinematics in Physics 1)

There are two main forces are play with a Swerve Drive:

* Linear force, which you can think as a force moving it in a straight line
* Rotational force, which you can think as a force that rotates an object

We can combine these two forces using kinematics in order to move in any direction and rotation at the same time!
